*
* Summary:
*  Handles communication through USBUART and implement circular buffers to
*  hold more than the 64 bytes allowed by USBUART.
* 
* Required files (see References):
*  ringbuf.h
*  ringbuf.c
*
* Required components in TopDesign:
*  1 x USBUART or UART (named 'COMM')
*
* Configuration of component USBUART (TopDesign):
*  Descriptor Root = "Manual (Static Allocation)"
*
* Clocks configurations for USBUART only (.cydwr):
*  IMO = 24MHz
*  ILO = 100kHz
*  USB = 48MHz (IMOx2)
*  PLL = 79.5MHz (or as high as you want the CPU clock to be)
*
* Macros to set (see below):
*  Select the type of communication block used in your TopDesign.
*  Set the frequency of the interrupt that will fill/empty RX/TX buffers.
*  Set the size of the FIFO buffers (Rx and Tx).
*
* System configurations (.cydwr):
*  Heap Size (bytes) = RX_BUFFER_SIZE + TX_BUFFER_SIZE + 2 bytes
*                      (plus 512 bytes if you use 'sprintf')
*                      (plus any more heap required for your application)
*
* Libraries:
*  You will need to add the 'math' library to the linker. Not doing so will not
*  show any errors during compilation or runtime, but the communication
*  may still not work without any indications of what's wrong. Here are the
*  steps:
*    1- Right-click on your project in the 'Workspace Explorer' and click on
*       'Build Settings...'.
*    2- In the left panel of the window, find the 'Linker' item. It should be
*       inside the compiler item (which can look like
*       'ARM GCC 5.4-2016-q2-update').
*    3- In the 'Additional Libraries' field, simply add the letter 'm' (lower
*       case).
*    4- Done! Click 'OK' to save your changes and close the window.
*
* Custom messages:
*  If you want to send/receive messages with a custom structure, make sure
*  this line is uncommented:
*    #include "usbuart_driver_msg.h"
*  And fill in the information in the file "usbuart_driver_msg.h".
*  Otherwise, you can comment the line mentionned previously and it will
*  deactivate all the functions related to custom messages.
